    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the &lt;html&gt; tag.</p>
    <p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML
      the page is written in.</p>
    <p>In HTML 4.01, the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies
      the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.</p>
    <p>HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.
    </p>
    <p>Always add the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration to your HTML documents, so that the browser knows what type of
      document to expect.</p>
